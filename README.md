# Programming in C++

Collection of the assignments for a course I took during my master. They're fairly simple exercises. Nothing too complicated.

The selection of topics treated in the course and in the assignments were a little weird for a course that aimed at teaching people how to program in C++ (it was more like a course intended for people with basic programming skills, to be introduced to "abstractions" with a taste of C++). 

It's definitely not a comprehensive use of what C++ offers as a language. I have rewritten a lot of the code later, after studying C++ properly.

## Assignments Overview:

* Assignment 1  - The classic "Hello World". I didn't even bother uploading it.
* Assignment 2  - Basics: loops, writing expressions, using functions, etc.
* Assignment 3  - Basics: same as 2, mostly.
* Assignment 4  - Containers: the point of the assignment is to choose the most appropriate container for a specific scenario.
* Assignment 5  - Containers: same as 4.
* Assignment 6  - User classes definition (also how to organize a project in different files).
* Assignment 7  - Operators for classes and overloading.
* Assignment 8  - Class Inheritance.
* Assignment 9  - Recursion... A bit weird to be treated this late...
* Assignment 10 - Double-Linked List.
* Assignment 11 - Tree: built by the user through double linked lists.
